![Dashboard Analytics Page](/Images/Clipped_Analytics_Page_Image_2.png)

## Introduction 

This dashboard was created for **leadership teams** to provide a clear, data-driven view of organisational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions performance against reduction targets. This enables Carbon to become a decision-making metric within management conversations - not simply an annual disclosure exercise. This dashboard was created using an *example dataset* as to not expose any real client data. 

## Skills Showcased

- **Data Transfromations (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns. 
- **Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs such as 'Emissions vs Baseline' and 'Change in Emissions vs Previous Year'.
- **Core Charts:** Utilised an array of **Column, Bar, Line**, and **Decomposition Tree Charts** to compare emissions by scope, subcategory and site and to track the top contributors to emisisons.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualise the distribution of emissions by site.
- **KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics via *Tooltip* and **Tables** to illustrate granular, sortable data for in depth analysis.
- **Dashboard Design:** Desined an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best demonstrate the story of the data.
- **Interactive Reporting:**
    - **Slicers:** To dynamically filter report pages by Scope and Year.
    - **Buttons and Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience throuuhgout the dashboard.
    - **Tooltip** To navigate from a higih level view to a contextual detailed view of speciifc statistics. 

## Dashboard Overview

### Page 1: High-Level Organisation View

This is an analytics view providing granular organisational emissions data, with key contributors to the gap from the emissions target per subcategory identified.

Focus areas are derived through  the prioirty score matrix combining *impact, performance and materiality* alongisde emissions variance in tCO2e, ensuring efforts to reduce emissions concentrate on the highest impact sources.

## Conclusion
This dashboard showcases how Power Bi can transform raw carbon emissions data into a powerful tool for GHG inventory analysis. It allows users to slice, filter and drill-down into data to make informed emissions-related decisions within their organisation to reduce their emissions and become more sustainable.
